This is our project for college in web technology subject

In order to use this project you need to install XAMPP and create folder library in htdocs folder so that you can use localhost to test this application.
Then you need to add this files to library folder and also you need to create database called library and add sql file in phpmyadmin dashboard.

For front-end, we have used a template so it's not our work, we have only handeled the back-end side.
